# luaegui
egui bindings for mlua. 

This allows you to call egui functions inside Luau using mlua. This allows a live scripting environment to experiment with egui, as well as allow plugins/addons of your application to have their own UI when they need it.

Just look at the example for basic usage. You can play with the web version live at https://coderedart.github.io/luaegui/

The API itself is still very much in flux as i am trying to figure out the most natural way to use egui from lua. And that is why there is no release yet. Consider this to be very much in alpha stage. If you have any suggestions, create a new issue :)
